# Advanced Land Record NER System

A production-grade Named Entity Recognition (NER) system designed to extract key entities (Buyer, Seller, Amount, Survey No, Location, Date) from unstructured legal land record texts.

**Performance:** 1.0 F1 Score (Validation) | **Architecture:** BiLSTM-CRF + GloVe

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Pure AI Model**: No hardcoded rules. The model uses deep learning to understand context (e.g., distinguishing "Purchased by" vs "Sold by").
*   **Massive Synthetic Data**: Trained on **15,000** linguistically diverse sentences generated by a custom Combinatorial Grammar Engine.
*   **Robustness**: specifically trained to ignore common hallucinations like "Executed on" or confusing Dates with Transaction Amounts.
*   **Vocabulary**: ~2,230 legal tokens supported.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Model**: PyTorch (BiLSTM, CRF)
*   **Embeddings**: GloVe 6B 100d
*   **Interface**: Streamlit
*   **Data Processing**: Pandas, Scikit-learn

## 📦 Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/LandRecord_NER.git
    cd LandRecord_NER
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Important**: Download GloVe Embeddings
    The model requires `glove.6B.100d.txt` in the `data/glove/` directory. You can download it from [PROJET URL HERE] or ensure the script `src/setup_glove.py` is run if included.

## 🏃 Usage

Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The system uses a **Bidirectional LSTM** to capture sentence context from both directions, fed into a **Conditional Random Field (CRF)** layer that enforces valid tag sequences (e.g., `I-sELLER` cannot follow `B-BUYER`). This ensures grammatically consistent entity extraction.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset was generated using `src/generate_data_advanced.py`, creating 15,000 unique examples covering:
*   Active/Passive Voice
*   Legal Definitions ("The Transferor is...")
*   Complex Monetary Expressions
*   Ambiguous Date/Amount contexts
